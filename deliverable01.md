*Pitch:* Live Chat Support for Cannabis Delivery Platform

*Problem:*

Cannabis delivery, being a niche service, often leaves customers with many questions about products, delivery timelines, legal regulations, etc. Additionally, trust and reassurance are paramount for users when purchasing such products. Current channels of communication (e.g., email, phone) may be too slow or cumbersome for the fast-paced delivery model.

*Appetite:*
2 weeks. We're looking to implement a simple, robust live chat feature that integrates seamlessly with our existing platform. We're not aiming for advanced chatbot capabilities, but rather a direct line of communication between users and our support staff.

*Solution:*
Integrate a live chat widget on the bottom right corner of the app/website that expands upon clicking.
Notification systems for support staff when a user initiates a chat.
Pre-defined scripts for common questions (like delivery time, delivery issues, product information) to help support staff provide quick responses.
Chat history for users to review past conversations, enhancing user experience.
Capability for users to rate their chat experience, providing feedback for continuous improvement.

*Rabbit Holes:*
Integrating AI-powered chatbot: While this might improve efficiency, it could also lead to miscommunication or user frustration, especially if bot responses aren’t accurate.
Over-customization of chat UI: Spending too much time on chat aesthetics rather than functionality can delay the implementation.
Depending on third-party services that require heavy customization or that don’t align with our data privacy standards.

*No Gos:*
Video or voice chat: Sticking to text-based chat to ensure quick, concise communication and to avoid potential regulatory complications with video/voice.
Multi-agent chat (more than one support staff chatting with a user at once): This can confuse the user and isn’t necessary for our initial roll-out.
Archiving chat histories for more than 30 days: To ensure data privacy and reduce storage needs.
