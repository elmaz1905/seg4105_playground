**CHAP 7: BETS, NO BACKLOGS**

- No backlogs: Backlogs, which can accumulate dozens or hundreds of tasks over time, are viewed as unnecessary and burdensome.
- Backlogs as time-wasters: Constantly reviewing, grooming, and organizing old ideas in backlogs hinders progress on current, timely projects.
- Betting table: Instead of backlogs, stakeholders gather before each six-week cycle at a "betting table" to decide on the next cycle's projects.
- Few well-shaped options: Only a few risk-reduced options from the last six weeks are considered, eliminating the need for a long list of ideas.
- Infrequent, productive meetings: With a limited set of options and a six-week cycle, meetings are short and focused.
- Bet or let go: If a pitch is chosen, it goes into the next cycle for development; if not, it is discarded without tracking.
- Advocating for pitches: If a great pitch's timing isn't right, advocates can track it independently and lobby for it in the future.
- Decentralized lists: Different departments can maintain their own lists of ideas, requests, or bugs without relying on a central backlog.
- Cross-pollination: Regular one-on-one meetings between departments help share ideas and concerns for future projects.
- Fresh conversations: Everything brought back is relevant and timely, maintaining a context and purpose.
- Important ideas resurface: Valuable ideas tend to resurface naturally, while less critical issues may fade away or reappear when necessary.
- Motivation for solutions: Persistent issues motivate teams to shape solutions and seek betting time in upcoming cycles.

**CHAP 8: THE BETTING TABLE**
- Six-week cycles: Projects are scheduled in standardized six-week cycles, simplifying resource allocation.
- Downsides of two-week cycles: Two-week cycles are deemed too short for meaningful work due to planning overhead.
- Cool-down: After each six-week cycle, there are two weeks of cool-down with no scheduled work, allowing teams to breathe, meet as needed, and consider future projects.
- Team and project sizes: Projects are handled by teams consisting of one designer and two programmers or one designer and one programmer, with QA integration testing later.
- The betting table: Stakeholders decide the projects for the next cycle during cool-down, focusing on a few well-shaped options, avoiding backlogs or grooming.
- Meeting participants: The betting table typically includes the CEO, CTO, a senior programmer, and a product strategist.
- Betting vs. planning: The term "betting" is used to set expectations for meaningful work, commitments, and capped downside risks.
- Uninterrupted time: Teams are not interrupted during the six-week cycle; commitments are honored, and interruptions can lead to significant setbacks.
- The circuit breaker: Projects must ship within the six-week cycle; the circuit breaker prevents runaway projects and encourages reframing problems.
- Handling bugs: Bugs are addressed during cool-down, brought to the betting table if significant, or dealt with during dedicated bug smash cycles.
- Keeping a clean slate: Capacity management involves only betting one cycle at a time and shaping old work as new potential bets.
- Maximizing future options: Betting one cycle at a time keeps options open for responding to unexpected events or ideas.
- Multi-cycle projects: Even for projects that span multiple cycles, each cycle is shaped with a specific endpoint, allowing flexibility to change course if needed.

**CHAP 9: PLACE YOUR BETS**

- Reflection based on product's development phase: The approach to the six-week cycle depends on whether the focus is on improving an existing product or building a new one.
  
Existing Products:
- Standard Shape Up process: Shape the work, bet on it, and have a team build it with an expectation to finish and ship within the cycle.
- Existing code and design provide a framework for new features, similar to crafting furniture for an already-built house.

New Products:
- Building new products involves three distinct phases that unfold over multiple cycles, but each cycle is still bet one at a time.
  
R&D Mode:
- Earliest stage of a new product where the concept is theoretical, and technical decisions are uncertain.
- Focus on learning and experimentation; shaping is fuzzier, betting on key pieces, and not expecting to ship at the end of the cycle.
- Senior team members are involved, and the aim is to create a foundation for future work.
- No customer-facing shipping occurs, and decisions about continuing R&D are made cycle by cycle.

Production Mode:
- Architectural decisions are settled, and the core product functionality is established.
- Transition to formal cycles with clear shaping, betting, and building phases.
- Shaping becomes more deliberate, and multiple teams (if available) can work in parallel.
- Shipping is the goal, with the definition of shipping being merging into the main codebase without expecting further changes.

Cleanup Mode:
- The phase before launching the new product, characterized by a flexible and free-for-all approach.
- No shaping; leadership guides the cycle, addressing what's important and eliminating distractions.
- No clear team boundaries; everyone contributes as needed.
- Work is continuously shipped in small increments.
- Capacity is reserved for the unexpected and for addressing issues that arise closer to launch.
- Leadership makes final decisions about the product's feature set, aiming for a smaller, more manageable surface area.
