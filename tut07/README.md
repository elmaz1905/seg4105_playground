**CHAPTER 13: SHOW PROGRESS**


As a developer, your task to keep track of progress would include:

*Updating Scopes:*

- You would define and update the scopes of work as they evolve, ensuring that both completed and newly discovered tasks are reflected accurately.

*Tracking on the Hill Chart:*

- You would track the progress of each scope on a hill chart, indicating whether it is in the uphill phase (problem-solving and discovery) or downhill phase (execution).

*Communicating Uncertainty:*

- Instead of giving precise estimates, you would communicate the level of uncertainty and what is known or unknown about each scope.

*Solving and Reporting Issues:*

When encountering unknowns that stall progress, you would report these issues, possibly using the hill chart to visually indicate the challenge, without having to admit uncertainty directly.

*Refactoring Scopes:*

If a scope is too broad or mixed, causing confusion about its status, you would break it down into smaller parts that can be more easily managed and tracked for progress.

*Building and Validating Approaches:*

You would engage in hands-on work to validate your approaches, moving a scope uphill only when you are confident that there are no significant unknowns remaining.

*Prioritizing Work:* 

You would prioritize tackling the most uncertain or riskiest tasks first to prevent any surprises in the later stages of the project.







# Daily Scrum Meeting

## Purpose
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This meeting is instrumental in:

- Enhancing collaboration and performance
- Inspecting work since the last Daily Scrum
- Forecasting work for the upcoming Sprint

The ultimate goal is to optimize the chances of meeting the Sprint Goal.

## Daily Questions
During the Daily Scrum, each Development Team member typically answers the following questions:

1. **What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?**
2. **What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?**
3. **Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?**

## Structure and Focus
While the structure of the Daily Scrum may vary, its focus is consistently on progress toward the Sprint Goal. The meeting aims to:

- Improve communication
- Eliminate unnecessary meetings
- Identify and remove impediments
- Promote quick decision-making
- Increase the team's level of knowledge

## Attendance and Conduct
This meeting is for the Development Team. If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures they do not interfere with the meeting process.

## Importance
The Daily Scrum is a key inspect and adapt meeting within the Scrum framework.
