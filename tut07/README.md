**CHAPTER 13: SHOW PROGRESS**


As a developer, your task to keep track of progress would include:

*Updating Scopes:*

- You would define and update the scopes of work as they evolve, ensuring that both completed and newly discovered tasks are reflected accurately.

*Tracking on the Hill Chart:*

- You would track the progress of each scope on a hill chart, indicating whether it is in the uphill phase (problem-solving and discovery) or downhill phase (execution).

*Communicating Uncertainty:*

- Instead of giving precise estimates, you would communicate the level of uncertainty and what is known or unknown about each scope.

*Solving and Reporting Issues:*

When encountering unknowns that stall progress, you would report these issues, possibly using the hill chart to visually indicate the challenge, without having to admit uncertainty directly.

*Refactoring Scopes:*

If a scope is too broad or mixed, causing confusion about its status, you would break it down into smaller parts that can be more easily managed and tracked for progress.

*Building and Validating Approaches:*

You would engage in hands-on work to validate your approaches, moving a scope uphill only when you are confident that there are no significant unknowns remaining.

*Prioritizing Work:* 

You would prioritize tackling the most uncertain or riskiest tasks first to prevent any surprises in the later stages of the project.
